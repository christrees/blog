What is the Short Term Rental Tax Loophole?

The short term rental loophole has saved people thousands of dollars a year in taxes because it doesn’t require you to be a real estate professional. It can be found in the tax code under Reg. Section 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A), and defines exceptions to the definition of “rental activity”.

Straight from the tax code, here are the six ways in which income for a rental property to be excluded from the definition of a rental activity, and thus not automatically passive:

The average period of customer use for such property is seven days or less.
The average period of customer use for such property is 30 days or less, and significant personal services are provided by or on behalf of the owner of the property in connection with making the property available for use by customers. This could include services like a hotel would provide, such as daily cleaning or meals.
Extraordinary personal services (same as above) are provided by or on behalf of the owner of the property in connection with making such property available for use by customers (without regard to the average period of customer use). 
The rental of such property is treated as incidental to a non rental activity of the taxpayer.
The taxpayer customarily makes the property available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers.
The provision of the property for use in an activity conducted by a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture in which the taxpayer owns an interest is not a rental activity.

Material Participation Tests for the Short Term Rental Tax Loophole

We mentioned before that earning a real estate professional status is one way to turn losses on rental properties. However, this isn’t typically an option for highly paid professionals like doctors or lawyers, because they don’t have half of their working time to work in a real estate business. The good news is that the short term rental tax loophole can help.

The exceptions to the definition of rental activities in the tax code listed above can also turn losses non-passive if you, the short term real estate investor, meet one of seven material participation criteria. These tests will determine whether you qualify based on your use of and involvement in your short term rental property.

Here they are:

Spend more than 500 hours on the short term rental business
Do substantially everything for the STR business
Spend more than 100 hours on the activity and no one other individual spends more time than you do
Significant participation activity for more than 100 hours, and your combined activity in all significant participation activities exceeds 500 hours
Participating in the business for five of the 10 previous taxable years
Personal service activity (non income-producing) for three of the previous taxable years
Regular, continuous, provable participation in the business for more than 100 hours
The first three are the ones the majority of short term real estate investors qualify for. 

Once you meet one of these tests, and your short-term rental is excluded from the definition of a rental activity, then it is considered non-passive.

STR Income and Non-Passive Losses

The goal of ticking these boxes is to use your short term rental for non-passive losses. This is what you want because non-passive losses can offset non-passive income. If you can meet the criteria, your short-term rental will save you money on taxes.

That’s the first big component of a short term rental tax strategy. The second is depreciation.

Depreciation for Your Short Term Rental Tax Strategy

If you get a savvy real estate CPA, they’re going to lead you through leveraging depreciation for your short term rental.

Here’s what they will help guide you on:

Having a cost segregation study on your property
That cost segregation will reclassify certain components of your property from 39 year life (depreciation life for an STR property) into 5 and 15 year life. This is for tangible personal property, land improvement property, and qualified improvement property. 
Here’s why this is powerful:

5 and 15 year property can generally represent anywhere from 20-30% of a property’s purchase price.

Example: if you had a $1 million dollar property and did a cost segregation structure, anywhere from 20-30% could be resegregated and fully depreciated. This would give you a $250,000 deduction. 

This is powerful because your losses are non-passive, and that tax loss can be used to offset taxes on your W-2 income.

What’s Changing About Depreciation for Short Term Rentals?

Since 2018, bonus depreciation for short term rentals and other business activities has been 100%. 2022 is the last year of 100% bonus depreciation. It is currently slated for a phased approach to decrease the percentage every year for the next five years.

This is what to expect:

In 2023, it will drop down to 80% bonus depreciation. 
For illustrative purposes, that would mean, if you were going to get a $250k deduction, you’d get $200k in 2023. 

In 2024, it will drop down to 60%. 
The $250k deduction would become $150k. Still sizable, but the power of the strategy will decrease.

In 2025, it will drop down to 40%. 
The $250k deduction would become $100k. 

In 2026, it will drop down to 20%. 
The $250k deduction would become $50k.

In 2027, it will disappear completely.
It may be changed and extended, but this is the current plan.

To be clear: The short term rental depreciation loophole itself is not on the chopping block and may never be on the chopping block. However, the 100% bonus depreciation is naturally phasing out as part of the current law, which will reduce the impact of the strategy.

Even when bonus depreciation phases out, you can depreciate portions of your property at 5 or 15 years instead of 39 years, which still represents an opportunity for savings. 

A comprehensive short term rental tax strategy is still the best way to get maximum benefits from short term rental investments.
