Chris Outline:

There are too many stories to share about mom, so decided on this sneek preview format:

I’m going to start with Mom being born in Joe and Ruth’s house, I would love to hear more stories around that.  

The next would be about Jean Patterson (Rodgers) taking mom as an infant in her bicycle basket to babysit.  That maybe an early sign of Mom’s tendency to roam, and the tendency for us kids to also form a habit of gravel road bicycle trips to the Rodgers… too many stories here and I promised not to go down the Patterson / Rodgers story rabbit hole so…

MOVING on…

Mom working as a soda jerk.  

Mom watching movies from the projection room of what is now Grasshorse.  

The little pink house, more friends and neighbors in Ft. Atkinson,
 Fixing TV so mom could watch Jack LaLane.  

Staying with everybody when Carol was born.  

Carol being absorbed into blender helping Carla and Mom.  

Cinnamon toast made with Chilli powder. 

Eating mistakes… I was the champion of that.

Many multi-generational extended family friendships… way too many to list. 

Then the Trips… way too many stories to even list…  but I want to mention one.. It involves Mark, Gwyn, Mom and Dad’s ‘Vacation in Willow Glen’... and chainsawing through my wall… 

Then of course… Doughnuts..
The Doughnut origin story, church basement doughnuts and Irene’s doughnut recipe.
Doughnuts all over the road to Joes. Camper Doughnuts, river Doughnuts, graduation Doughnuts, Doughnut exports with Kimberly and Jeromy.



Anyway…. I want to thank all for listening and sharing, and I hope to share more stories soon!
