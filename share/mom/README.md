Alice Anne Klopfenstein was born on April 8, 1936, at home in Winfield, the daughter of Fred and Hazel (Fletcher) Klopfenstein of Winfield Iowa. Alice was a graduate from Winfield High School and Iowa State University where she received a degree in Home Economics.

On March 23, 1957, Alice was united in marriage to Alan Trees at the United Methodist Church in Winfield.  After college, the newlyweds moved to Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.  In 1959 Alan worked for Jamesway Manufacturing Company and Alice baked their first creation called Carla.  Once Alice discovered baked custard could tame Carla, in 1962 Chris was baked.  With baked kids in-hand Alan and Alice moved back to Winfield and in 1965 one final baked creation was named Carol.  In the early 1980s, with only Carol providing in-home excitement, Alan and Alice imported another cookie named Anne-Marie, but Chris called her Joe.

This is too long so Iâ€™ll end it right here.  Ask those who know about fried things of dough and the stories will flow.

Alice was a member of the Winfield United Methodist Church, UMWA and TTT. She also served on the Henry County Fair and Winfield Library boards. She also enjoyed traveling with Alan (and others) in their RV all over the continental US. And yes, doughnuts were made. 

Alice will be deeply missed by her children, Carla (Brian) Trees of Winfield, Chris (Andrea) Trees of Cedar Falls and Carol (Brad) Fletcher of Cedar Falls; three grandchildren, Brennan Lee-Trees Haymond and Clint and Emma Fletcher; Dutch exchange student, Anne Marie Herlaar (Jacques) Dutoit and her children, Kimberly, Bastian and Louise; sisters-in-laws, Carol Klopfenstein and Ruth Klopfenstien; brother, Joe Klopfenstein; and the entire cast of nieces and nephews Steve (Dixie) Klopfenstein, Kim (Laurie) Klopfenstein, Ned (MeeSook) Klopfenstein, Paul (Carrie) Klopfenstein, Rex Klopfenstein, Betty (Gary) Metz, Sara (Tim) Tuschen, Neil (Chip) Klopfenstein and Jim (Sue) Klopfenstein, Candy (Ron) Fjetland, Neal Rabe, Mike (Colleen) Trees, Diane Erickson, David (Aya) Trees, Dena Trees.
