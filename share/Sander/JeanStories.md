Obituary
 

With profound sadness, we announce the passing of Wanda Jean Sander (Jean) (Grandma), 85, on October 19, 2021. She was a loving wife and devoted mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend.

Jean was born in Rising Star, Texas on March 14, 1936 and moved to California in 1960. Her early California years were spent raising her sons, Ed and Lance, enjoying time with close friends she made while working for Life Saver, Paul Masson Winery and at San Jose State University. Balancing work and motherhood, she somehow found time to go dancing. That is how one fateful night she met her loving husband Wendell Sander, father of four. Jean and Wendell had a charming backyard wedding in 1975, merging two families into one.

In the early 1980’s they became grandparents and built their dream home, giving rise to Jean’s love of gardening and her devotion to her grandchildren. She loved to watch her hard work bloom, spending long days in the garden with Missy (her beloved dog). Her famous family gatherings were a lot of hard work, but her amazing southern cooking always made them deliciously worth the effort.  Jean was dedicated to her family and provided a loving home to many over the years, including her granddaughters, Jessica, Christina, and Nickie. Her home was always open to family and friends, and everyone called her grandma. She will be dearly missed and forever in our hearts.

Along with her husband Wendell, she is survived by her son and his wife, Ed and Patti Mitchell, her son Lance Mitchell, her stepchildren, Eric Sander, Brian and his wife Maxine Sander, Laura Sander, and Sara Behen. Jean was blessed with many grandchildren, Jessica & Fabian, Christina, Ryan & Sarah, Dennis & Marisela, Casey & Crystal, William, Nickie & Darius, Brendon, Mark, Katrina, Mariah, Nina & Brandon, Lorenz, Natalia, Daniel, Helena, and great-grandchildren Santino, Dakoda, Haydyn, Noe, Jasper, Barrett, Zelda, Melody, Zarina, and Ezekiel.
