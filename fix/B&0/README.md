# Bang & Olufsen Beogram 4004 - Repair

Ken has an B&0 Beogram 4004 turntable that has the following issues:

1. Linear tracking would not move
2. Stylus would not drop
3. May have electrical connection issue with RCA adaptor

Ken's previous research indicated that the beeswax lubricant used could freeze the slide mechanism.  He attempted to use the hairdryer heat method to release the lubricant.  The attempt was unsuccessful.
