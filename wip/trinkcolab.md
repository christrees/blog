Colabrative projects with Trink

[Edit](https://github.com/christrees/blog/edit/master/wip/trinkcolab.md)

## TrinkTV
Goal: Stable Plex server running in CF maintainable by mdt and cat.

### Plex Rebuilds 2022.08.12-14
Synopsys --
Use Window 10/11 with i5+ gen 10+ machine and map storage over network.

One of the ongoing issues is plex clients asking for transcode when its not required. 

[Avoid Plex transcoding](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/avoid-transcoding/)

Notes:
DVR recording takes very little cpu, but transcoding basically requries a gpu or lots of cores.
- macci - trink's old mini after rebuild would only playback to portals (aka portal client can take original format)
- trintv - old admin2cld-win10 Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU E8400  @ 3.00GHz added trinks old video card and it could almost handle transcode to one web client
- HPi5 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G1 CPU @ 1.00GHz - laptop I've been using could almost handle 4 recording and playback HD streams to web clinets NOTE gen 10 so has GPU built in.
- catmini - i7 

## Robot Simulation
Goal: Spider robot on table simulation running by both mdt and cat.
Goal: Protomotion robot running simulation by both mdt and cat.
