## Julian Doub mentions
- Mid-Senior Full Stack JavaScript Developer:
- 4+ years Node.JS
- 4+ years React (redux is a plus)
- Strong SQL skills (any database)
- AWS experience of any amount is a plus

This team is very small, you will be one of three devs, a PO and  UX person. The team has no QA team. So, strong automated/unit testing skills (basically a good debugger) is a core part of this role
