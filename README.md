## 2021.04.11 Feeling burnt out
[Burnout-Attitudes](./Burnout-Attitudes.png)

Going to push on [gh learn-bg-anvil](http://gh.2cld.net/docs/blender/tutorial/learn-bg-anvil).  Need to cleanup my blender links also as I have them in [2cld/gh/docs/blender](https://github.com/2cld/gh/tree/master/docs/blender) and [christrees/blog/blender](https://github.com/christrees/blog/tree/master/blender).  Also need to find and cleanup what I have on the other tests.

## 2021.04.10 Grasshorse Cleanup
The intent today was to move more stuff out of the basement, but it was cold and rainly.  Did stop into the house and the roof is leaking between addition and main old house.  Brad, Brayden and myself then took a stab at grasshorse cleaning.  My goal is to keep defending corners and pushing out.  Brad and I got the SW basement corner cleared.  I intended to trace down the chiller unit as I think I can remove it also.  We took what I think is intended to be trash (the old lights) and sat them on the dock and dock-loading area.  We then moved to the NE basement corner and did a first pass clear and clean.  We started on the woodshop area NE corner.  This is the corner Brayden and I cleared last time, so this was the 'defend and expand'.  We did clear the vertical surfaces we had cleared last time, but at that point I had ran into more signs of non-progress I hit the SNAFU limit.

## 2021.04.09 More Maintainance
Cleared some more basement.  Got to the old leak pipe runs.  Thinking the leak was the laundry water I pulled drywall to get to it.  I think the water actually came from some sort of laundry overflow, not a leak in the supply pipe.  I pulled the washer and found the water was reversed Hot to Cold.  I also found the supply hot hose screen was corroded shut.  I pulled the screens and replace rubber washers.  That seemed to fix the washer.  The dryer vent was off.  I pulled the Dryer, attached the exhaust hoses. There was a lot of lint build up.  I pulled the front face of the dryer and vacumed the lint from everywhere including the felt seals both front and back.  Removing the front also made attaching the exhaust easier.  Dryer worked and also blew out a wad of lint from the exhaust pipe.

## 2021.04.04 Project Catchup
### Update [Blender Learning Project - Youtube](https://youtu.be/05pc088bPlA)
[Blender Learning Project - Youtube](https://youtu.be/05pc088bPlA) overview of what I was doing 6 months ago before I went to [T3 Farms](http://blog.christrees.com/farm/T3Farms/) to help pump poo.  I stopped the blender and the bathroom renovation rendering project.  This is a recap to myself and Gus so he keeps on me to review my progress.  BTW... I should model the new and improved T3 Farms equipment too.

### Update [ConverseHouse Website](https://conversehouse.com/)
I missed Al's email about the Zoom conference Friday night.  So I figured I'd go test the virtual links I setup to test on 2/24.  I added links to meeting rooms that should never expire BUT will require a conversehouse domain user to enter the room and accept any non-members request to enter.  I also added a room via the webapp I experimented with [https://zoom-app-clone.herokuapp.com/conversehouse](https://zoom-app-clone.herokuapp.com/conversehouse).  It mostly works and if people start using it, I'll fix the issues and make it into an app.  I also made the main site secure.
  
## 2021.04.03 - 2021.03.18 - Farm'n and Clean'n
Spend a few weeks down on the farm.
### The Bat Kite
I won the Cub Scout spring kite flying contest with this kite circa 1970... I think.  Found it while cleaning out my basement room at the folks place.

### Clean'n stuff
I reached the far SE corner of the basement!  Moved stuff not touched since 1970's I think.

![20210403-ChrisTrees-ClearSECorner-IMG_1244.JPG](./share/image/20210403-ChrisTrees-ClearSECorner-IMG_1244.JPG)

I also reached the far NE corner, which was the office.  I think the stuff in the corner was placed (by me) in 2004.  Maybe I'll try to find a photo before I cleared.  I only cleared about 1/2 square foot, but I did get to the 2 East corners of the basement.  Now I just have to defend and expand the corners until I clear the entire basement.
