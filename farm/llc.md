## Grain Marketing
1. Set a minimum sell price based on your cost of production and set a realistic high price. 
2. Estimate how many bushels would be 70% of your average production.
3. In April, May and June, make seven sales (70% of production divided by 10) when prices are within your price range.
4. On July 1, price any remaining portions of that 70%.
5. For the remaining 30% of your grain, develop a postharvest marketing plan.
