Notes for Brad.

The sisters and I created 4 LLCs
- FH Klopfenstein Farms, LLC which owns the 80 acres on the highway
- Trees AES, LLC which owns Mom's 20 acres with her house and the Rental house
- TH Twig, LLC which is basically Brian, Carla, and myself to dump Dad's tools and a service repair company.
- Fletcher Motors Co, LLC which is Brad, Carol, and myself to dump vehicles.

The idea is as we split stuff up... basically, one of the LLCs buys it from the estate.

## Option 1 - Buyin of Trees AES, LLC
- Appraised $449,242 value of Trees AES
- Buildings $156,293
- Land      $292,949 (19.1 at $15,388/ac)

I've talked to the sisters and brother-in-laws about you buying into the LLC.  We all (Carla, Carol, and Chris) are up for that as the house needs a refresh (which was why TH Twig was created).

- A buy-in of $250,000 would put Trees AES, LLC at $699,242 total value.
- The stake would be 36% and drop us to 64% which is about 22% each (Carla, Chris, and Carol)
- We put in the LLC Buy-Sell Agreement the first right of refusal.
- Use cash to upgrade and clean up.
- I would also suggest we look at other farm home properties to upgrade and manage... a longer discussion. 

## Conclusion
I'd like to do something with you primarily to get Carmen back here to make house refresh calls.  
I think I could probably get Keith Davis and his wife to do farmhouse refreshes for retirement.
I also started to work with Kathy and Karen Jennings on the same sort of stuff... they also have the issue.
