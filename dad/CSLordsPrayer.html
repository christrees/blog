<h1>Our Father which art in heaven,</h1>
<h2>Our Father-Mother God, all-harmonious,</h2>

<h1>Hallowed be Thy name.</h1>
<h2>Adorable One.</h2>

<h1>Thy kingdom come.</h1>
<h2>Thy kingdom is come; Thou art ever-present.</h2>

<h1>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</h1>
<h2>Enable us to know, — as in heaven, so on earth, — God is omnipotent, supreme.</h2>

<h1>Give us this day our daily bread;</h1>
<h2>Give us grace for to-day; feed the famished affections;</h2>

<h1>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</h1>
<h2>And Love is reﬂected in love;</h2>

<h1>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;</h1>
<h2>And God leadeth us not into temptation, but delivereth us from sin, disease, and death.</h2>


<h1>For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.</h1>
<h2>For God is inﬁnite, all-power, all Life, Truth, Love, over all, and All.</h2>
